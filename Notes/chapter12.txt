Chapter 12 Dialogs

Dialog is an instance of AlertDialog, a subclass of Dialog.  AlertDialog is the all purpose Dialog subclass that you will use most often.
	-There is a DatePickerDialog subclass of AlertDialog
AlertDialog is wrapped in an instance of DialogFragment, a subclass of Fragment
	It is possible to display AlertDialog without a DialogFragment but Android does not recommend it
	Having the Dialog managed by the FragmentManager gives more options for presenting the dialog
	AlertDialog will vanish if the device is rotated unless it is wrapped in a Fragment

setTargetFragment(Fragment fragment, int requestCode)
	This method accepts the fragment that will be the target and requests a code just like the one used in startActivityForResult()
	The Target fragment can use the request code later to tell which fragment is reporting back
	The FragmentManager keeps track of the target fragment and request code
		You can retrieve them by calling getTargetFragment() and getTargetRequestCode() on the fragment that has the target set
