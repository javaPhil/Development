Chapter 23 - More about Intents and Tasks

Android uses tasks to keep track of the user's state within each running application

A task is a stack of activities that the user is connected with.
	-The activity at the bottom of the stack is called the base activity, and whatever activity is on top is the activity that the user sees
	-When you press the back button, you are popping the top activity off of this stack
	-If you are looking at the base activity, hitting the back button will send you back to the home screen
	
Using the task manager, you can switch between tasks without affecting each task's state
	-For instance, if you start entering a new contact and switch to checking your Twitter feed, you will have two tasks started.
	-If you switch back to editing contacts, your place in both tasks will be saved

Sometimes when you start a new activity, you want the activity added to the current task
	-Other times you want it started in a new task that is independent of the activity that started it
	
By default, new activities are started in the current task
