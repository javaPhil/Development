ViewPager
	-Lets users navigate between list items by swiping across the screen to "page" forward and backward
	-ViewPager is like an AdapterView (the superclass of ListView) in some ways
		-An AdapterView requires an Adapter to provide views
		-A ViewPager requires a PagerAdapter
	-By Default ViewPager shows the first item in its PagerAdapter
		-You can have it show the crime that was selected by setting the ViewPager's current item to the index of the selected crime
