Chapter 17 Saving and Loading Local Files

Every application needs a place to save data.  This one will use a JSON file.

Each application on an Android device has a directory in its sandbox.
	Keeping files in the sandbox protects them from being accessed by other applications or even the prying eyes of users (unless the device has been rooted)
	Each sandbox directory is a child of the device's /data/data directory named after the application package

In addition to the sandbox, your application can store files in external storage
	Typically this is a SD card that may or may not be available on the device
	Files or whole applications can be stored on an SD card but there are security implications to doing so
	Most importantly, access to files on external storage is not restricted to your application - anyone can read, write and delete them
	
Adding persistent data storage to an app involves two processes:
	Saving the data out to the file system and loading that data back in when the application is launched
Each process has two stages.
In saving, you first transform the data into a storable format and then you write that data to a file.
In loading, you read the formatted data from the file and then parse it into what the application needs

JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation, a format that has become popular in recent years especially with web services

Android includes the standard org.json package, which has classes that provide simple access to creating and parsing files in JSON format.

XML is another option for formatting data in order to write it to a file and android provides classes for that package as well
