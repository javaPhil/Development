Chapter 8 Creating User Interfaces with Layouts and Widgets

Theme - is a collection of styles
	-A style resource whose attributes point to other style resources
	-The Android platform provides themes that your apps can use
	-Holo light with Dark Action Bar etc
	-You can apply a style from the app's theme to a widget using a theme attribute reference.
		-Theme attribute reference - you tell Android's runtime resource manager "Go to the app's theme and find the attribute labled listSeperatorTextViewStyle
			-This resource points to another style resource
Screen Pixel Densities and DP and SP
	-Android automatically scales images to different screen pixel densities using the drawable-ldpi -mdpi -hdpi directories
	dp - Short for density-independent pixel
		-Typically used for margins padding, or anything else you would otherwise specify a size with a pixel value
		-When your display is a higher density, density-independent pixels will expand to fill a larger number of screen pixels.
		-1 dp is always 1/160th of an inch on a devices screen
	sp - short for scale-independent pixel.
		-SP are density-independent pixels that also take into account the user's font size preference.
		-You will almost always use SP to set display text size
	pt, mm, in - These are scaled units like dp that allow you to specify interface sizes in points, millimeters, or inches
Layout Paramters
	-Attributes whos names do not begin with layout_ are directions to the widget
	-When it is inflated, the widget clals a method to configure itself based on each of these attributes and their values
	-When an attribute's name begins with layout_, that attribute is a direction to that widget's parent
		-These attributes are known as layout parameters and they tell the parent layout how to arrange the child element within the parent
	-Even when a layout object like LinearLayout is the root element of a layout, it is still a widget with a parent and has layout parameters
Margin attributes - layout parameters
	-They determine the distance between widgets
Padding attributes
	-Padding tells the widget how much bigger than its contents it should draw itself
