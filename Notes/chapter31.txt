Chapter 31 - Browsing the Web & WebView

You will browse to this URL first by using your old friend implicit intent.  This intent will start up the browser with your photo URL

Sometimes, you want to display web content within your own activities instead of heading off to the browser
	-You may want to display HTML that you generate yourself, or you may want to lock down the browser window somehow
	-For apps that include help documentation, it is common to implement it as a web page so that its easy to update
	
When you want to present web content within your own user interface, you use the WebView class

Progress updates and title updates have their own callback methods onProgressChanged() and onRecievedTitle()
	-The progress you receive from onProgressChanged is an integer from 0 to 100.  If it is 100 you know the page is done loading, so you hide ProgressBar
	
For some classes like VideoView, the Android documentation recommends that you allow the activity to handle the configuration change itself
	-This means that instead of the activity being destroyed, it simply moves its views around to fit the new screen size
	-As a result, WebView does not have to reload all of its data
