Chapter 14 Retained Fragments

When the device is rotated the HelloMoonActivity is destroyed.  It calls onPause() onStop() and onDestroy()
	In onDestroy() the MediaPlayer object is released which stops the media

Fragments have a feature that you can use to keep the MediaPlayer instance alive across a configuration change
	setRetainInstance(true) because it is default set to false
	When a fragment is retained, the fragment is not destroyed with the activity
	Instead it is preserved and passed along to the new activity

During a configuration change, the FragmentManager first destroys the views of the fragment in its list
	Fragment views always get destroyed and recreated on a configuration change for the same reasons that the activity views are destroyed and recreated
		If you have a new configuration, then you might need new resources
		Just incase better matching resources are now available, you rebuild the view from scratch
	Next, the FragmentManager checks the retainInstance property of each fragment
		If it is false which is default, then the FragmentManager destroys the fragment instance
		If it is set to true, then the fragment's view is destroyed, but the fragment itself is not
		When the new activity is created, the new FragmentManager finds the retained fragments and recreates its view
