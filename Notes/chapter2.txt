Chapter 2 Android and Model-View-Controller (MVC!)

MVC - states that any object in the application must be a model object, a view object, or a controller object
	-Model object holds the applications data and "business logic"
	-View objects know how to draw themselves on screen and how to respond to user input, like touches.
	-Controller objects tie the view and the model objects together.  They contain "application logic".
	-Controllers are designed to respond to various events triggered by view objects and manage the flow of data. (Just like Servlets)
	-Android Controllers are typically a subclass of Activity, Fragment, or Service
	-Objects in the view layer are normally inflated from XML within a layout file.
Strings.XML
	-You can use the \ escape sequence to get special characters to show up correctly
	-Can also use \n for a newline
