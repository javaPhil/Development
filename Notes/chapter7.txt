Chapter 7 - UI Fragments and the Fragment Manager

Fragment - is a controller object that an activity can deputize to perform tasks.
	-More commonly, the task is managing a user interface
	-The UI can be the entire screen or just one part of the screen
UI Fragment - a fragment managing a user interface
	-A UI Fragment has a view of its own that is inflated from a layout file
	-The Fragment's view contains the interesting UI elements that the user wants to see and interact with
	-The activity's view contains a spot where the fragment's view will be inserted, or it might have multiple spots for the views of several fragments
	-You can use fragments associated with the activity to compose and re-compose the screen as your app and users require
	-The activity's view technically stays the same throughout its lifetime and no laws of android are violated
Fragments Lifecycle
	-It is very similar to an activity's lifecycle
	-One critical difference between the fragments and activity's lifecycles is that fragment lifecycle methods are called by the hosting activity, not the OS
	-The OS knows nothing about the fragments that an activity is using to manage things.
	-Fragments are the activity's internal business
Hosting a UI Fragment
	-Two options when hosting a UI fragment in an activity
		-Add the fragment to activity's layout
		-Add the fragment in the activity's code
	-The first approach is known as using a layout fragment
		-Simple but inflexible
		-If you add the fragment to the activity's layout, you hard-wire the fragment and its view to the activity's view and cannot swap out that fragment during the activity's lifetime
	-The second approach is more complex but you have more control at runtime over your fragments
	-You determine when the fragment is added to the activity and what happens to it after that
	-You can remove the fragment, replace it with another, and then add the first fragment back again
TextWatcher
	-TextWatcher has three methods
	-You can watch for different things and update the text based on what happens
Fragment
	-When the Fragment class was introduced to Honeycomb, the Activity class was changed to include a piece called the FragmentManager
	-The FragmentManager is responsible for managing your fragments and adding their views tot he activity's view hierarchy
	-The FragmentManager handles two things
		-A list of fragments
		-A Back stack of fragment transactions
Fragment Transactions
	-Are used to add, remove, attach, detach, or replace fragments in the fragment list
	-They are the heart of how you use fragments to compose and recompose screens at runtime.
	-The FragmentManager maintains a back stack of fragment transactions that you can navigate.
	-The add() method is the meat of the transactions
		-It has two parameters: a container view ID and the newly-created CrimeFragment
		-The container view ID should look familiar.
			-It is the resource ID of the FrameLayout that we defined in activity_crime.xml
			-It tells the FragmentManager where in the activity's view the fragment's view should appear
			-It is used as a unique identifier for a fragment in the FragmentManagers list
		-When you need to retrieve the CrimeFragment from the FragmentManager, you ask for it by container view ID
