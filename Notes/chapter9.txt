Chapter 9 - Displaying Lists with ListFragment

Singleton - is a class that allows only one instance of itself to be created
	-It exists as long as the application stays in memory, so storing the list in a singleton will keep the crime data available no matter what happens with activities, fragments, and their lifecycles
	-In Android, it is common to have a Context parameter be required for Singleton use
		-private CrimeLab(Context appContext)
	-Whenever you have an application wide singleton, it should always use the application context
