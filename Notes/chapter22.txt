Chapter 22 - Two Pane Master Detail interface

Alias resource - is a resource that points to another resource.
	-Alias resources live in the res/values and by convention, are defined in a refs.xml file
	
Callbacks
	-To delegate functionality back to the hosting activity, a fragment typically defines a callback interface named Callbacks
	-This interface defines work that the fragment needs done by its boss, the hosting activity
	-Any Activity that will host the fragment must implement this interface
	-With a callback interface, a fragment is able to call methods on its hosting activity without having to know anything about which activity is hosting it
	-To implement a callbacks interface, you must define a member variable that hodls an object that implements Callbacks
	-Then you cast the hosting activity to Callbacks and assign it to that variable
	-You assign the activity in the Fragment lifecycle method onAttach()
	-Similarly you set it to null with onDetatch()
